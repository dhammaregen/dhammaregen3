<p>Der Buddhismus hatte immer eine gewisse Besorgnis um den Begriff des „Menschen“. Das ist wenig verwunderlich, da die grundlegende Lehre des Buddha besagte, dass es kein Selbst gibt. Das hielt frühe Buddhisten nicht davon ab, ein ganzes Buch mit dem Titel „Beschreibung von Menschen“ (<em>Puggalapaññatti</em>) zu schreiben, das zum Abhidhamma gehört und sich ansonsten damit brüstet, überhaupt nicht in Begriffen von Menschen zu sprechen. Inzwischen bildete sich eine ganze Schule, die der These gewidmet war, der Buddha habe zwar nicht das „Selbst“ gelehrt, aber den „Menschen“. Andere Schulen lehnten das ab und argumentierten, vom „Menschen“ zu sprechen, sei lediglich ein Sprachgebrauch für etwas, das keine letztendliche Wirklichkeit besitzt. In moderner Zeit gehen manche Lehrer so weit, zu behaupten, der Buddha habe nicht wirklich gelehrt, dass es kein Selbst gebe, sondern lediglich, dass das Denken in Begriffen des Fehlens eines Selbst eine nützliche Strategie sei.</p>
<p>In all dem ging die Tatsache unter, dass der Buddha einen besonderen Fachausdruck erfand, um über den „Menschen“ zu sprechen. Dieses Wort ist <em>puggala</em> im Pali und <em>pudgala</em> im Sanskrit. Die Implikationen zu entwirren, die sich daraus für das Verständnis der Vorstellung von einem Menschen ergeben, wird etwas Zeit erfordern. Aber es gibt keinen Zweifel, dass es diesen Fachausdruck gibt, vor aller Augen versteckt.</p>
<p>Während es offensichtlich ist, dass das Wort <em>puggala</em> im Pali auf bestimmte Weise gebraucht wird, glaube ich nicht, dass wir uns wirklich im Klaren waren, wie speziell dieser Begriff ist. Oder vielleicht sollte ich sagen, ich war mir nicht im Klaren. Vielleicht war es für andere offensichtlich, aber mir ist noch keine Diskussion dazu begegnet. Ich denke, wir sind durch Vertrautheit abgestumpft, da <em>puggala</em> ein häufiges und übliches Wort im Pali ist.</p>
<p>Tatsächlich finden wir <em>puggala</em> über 3.000 mal in den Suttas und über 7.300 mal im Palikanon als Ganzem. Das Standardwort für „Mensch“, wird in den Suttas über 4.500 mal gebraucht und über 7.000 mal im Kanon als Ganzem. Es verdient Beachtung, dass <em>purisa</em> zwar in den Suttas und im Vinaya häufiger gebraucht wird als <em>puggala</em>, das aber im Abhidhamma umgekehrt ist; dort finden wir <em>puggala</em> 3.600 mal und <em>purisa</em> etwa 1.400 mal.</p>
<p>This pattern highlights the different uses of the terms. <em>Purisa</em> is not a technical term in Buddhism, although it does have some technical applications, as for example the <em>sappurisa</em>, the “true person”, or the <em>mahāpurisa</em>, the “great person”. Normally, however, it’s just used as an ordinary language word in similes, discussions and the like. When the Buddha was just talking about a person, he used <em>purisa</em>, just like anyone else would have.</p>
<p>But when he wanted to specify characteristics of certain individuals, he used <em>puggala</em>. All those discourses that talk about the “four kinds of person” or “four individuals”: that’s <em>puggala</em>. You’d never know that in most translations, though, because we translate both <em>purisa</em> and <em>puggala</em> as “person”. Again, there’s probably exceptions, but that’s the case with Bodhi, Thanissaro, and probably most others. Including me, until just now.</p>
<p>These numbers wouldn’t surprise any Pali scholar, as we’re used to seeing <em>puggala</em> commonly. But what most of us miss is that this is a highly unusual situation. In early Sanskrit <em>puruṣa</em> is the normal word for “person”, and we meet it commonly. We can’t really count the occurrences as we do in Pali, because there’s no clearly defined corpus, but in the collection of vaguely early Sanskrit I use it’s well over a thousand times. <em>Pudgala</em>, on the other hand, is not found at all. Or rather, it is found once, but in an interesting sense. Even in later non-Buddhist Sanskrit it appears vanishingly rarely, and quite possibly under Buddhist influence.</p>
<p>That exceptional early use is in the Arthaśāstra of Kauṭilya. This is traditionally ascribed to a minister under Chandragupta, so a century or so after the Buddha, although modern scholars think it’s quite a bit later than that. Regardless, it’s a detailed description of ancient India statecraft that often clarifies worldly conditions alluded to in the Suttas. It uses <em>pudgala</em> not to mean a person, but as a descriptor of gold. The sense is perhaps “mass”, or as Olivelle’s modern translation has it, “item” (2.14.7, 2.14.43).</p>
<p>This sense seems very distant from the Buddhist use, but it is closer to the Jain usage. Like the Buddhists, and unlike the Vedists, the Jains had <em>pudgala</em> as a technical term they used either the Sanskrit form <em>pudgala</em> or the Ardhamagadhi <em>poggala</em>). But for them it has the primary technical meaning of “matter”, or again perhaps “mass”, with “soul” and “flesh” as secondary senses.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Jains posit several kinds of “substantial reality” or “existent conglomerate” (Sanskrit <em>astikāya</em>, Pali <em>sakkāya</em>). One of those is “mass” or “matter” (<em>pudgala</em>), perhaps more precisely, “particulate matter” (Tattvārthasūtra 5.5, Isibhāsiyam 1.31, Uttarādhyayanasūtra 28.12).. This has two kinds: the “atom” (<em>anu</em>) and the “molecule” (<em>skandha</em>, Pali <em>khandha</em>).</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed readers will notice that these overlap with the Buddhist terms <em>sakkāya</em>, <em>puggala</em>, and <em>khandha</em>. As I have shown previously, <em>sakkāya</em> has the root sense of “mass”, “existent substance”. <em>Kāya</em> is ultimately fron the root <em>ci</em> to “heap” or “pile up”. The meaning lies semantically close to <em>khandha</em> (“aggregate”, “conglomerate”, “molecule”), and in fact <em>kāya</em> and <em>khandha</em> can substitute for each other in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>What is not so obvious is that, not just <em>puggala</em>, but none of these three terms are used in a technical sense in Vedism. They are shared between Buddhism and Jainism, though used in quite distinct applications.</p>
<p>Thus we have two indications that <em>puggala</em> has the sense “composite”, “mass”. Perhaps the use in the context of gold suggests the sense, “composite item”. This is supported by one of the extremely rare Brahmanical uses at Viṣṇu Purāṇa 5.30.13, where we find the notion that beings are <em>pudgalāśrayāḥ</em> (“comprised of a composite mass”) related to a criticism of those who assert not-self, i.e. Buddhists. Tedesco (see below) notes only six occurrences through the vast Sanskritic literature, all of which are late, and several of which seem confused with <em>puṅgala</em> or <em>pudgala</em> in the sense “beautiful”, which is a homonym, and a dubious one at that. He accepts only two genuine instances, which, as he says, were likely borrowed from the Buddhists or Jains.</p>
<p>Now, Pali is rich in words for “person”.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>purisa</em>: person, man (everyday)</li>
<li><em>nara</em>: person, man (slightly elevated)</li>
<li><em>macca</em>: mortal (only in doctrinal contexts emphasizing, well, mortality)</li>
<li><em>mātiya</em>: same</li>
<li><em>manussa</em>: human, literally “descendant of Manu”, the first man, cf. English “son of Adam”.</li>
<li><em>mānava</em>: usually “Vedic student” but rarely also same.</li>
<li><em>manuja</em>: another variation</li>
<li><em>mānusa</em>: another variation. There’s more, but I’ll spare you.</li>
<li><em>jana</em>: person, populace, folk (literally one who is born)</li>
<li><em>jantu</em>: poetic for person, occasionally child (literally offspring, kin)</li>
<li><em>posa</em>: poetic version of <em>purisa</em></li>
<li><em>porisa</em>: same</li>
<li><em>puma</em>: man, male human</li>
<li><em>pajā</em>: generation, populace</li>
</ul>
<p>So why did the Buddha invent a new term? Surely the pattern is clear: the Buddha adopted a term meaning “individual conglomerate” and applied it in the sense of an individual or person specifically to emphasize his doctrine that what we call a person is really comprised of interrelated systems of many different phenomena. This is why it is solely a technical term for person in Buddhism, and almost never used in this way outside of Buddhism. It also explains why the Buddha himself used it in a highly specific way. Whenever he talked generally about a person, he just used <em>purisa</em> like everyone else, unless he was getting fancy in poetry, in which case, who can blame a man for showing off his language skills? He deployed <em>puggala</em> solely when defining technical categories. You’ll find very rare exceptions to this pattern, where <em>puggala</em> is used in a verse or something. But it is a poor word that cannot be used outside its primary context.</p>
<p>Now, this finding bears on the unsettled problem of the etymology. Most sources will indicate that the etymology is unknown.</p>
<p>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B2#Sanskrit</p>
<p>A substantial attempt at this was made by Paul Tedesco, “Sanskrit pudgala—‘body, soul’”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 67, 1947, 172–7. This is referenced in the Wiktionary article indirectly via Manfred Mayrhofer’s <em>Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen [Etymological Dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan</em>, but he just refers back to Tedesco.</p>
<p>Tedesco’s article can be accessed for free on JSTOR:</p>
<p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/596084?seq=1</p>
<p>He argues that we derive <em>puggala</em> from <em>pṛthak</em> in the basic sense “separate individual”. The base form would be something like <em>puthukala</em>, with <em>-ala</em> suffix. Tedesco goes in some detail to the etymology, and I won’t repeat it here. But just to say, the note in Wiktionary that the voiced gemination is unexplained is not correct: Tedesco in §10 suggests the processes “well established for Middle Indic” of either sonorization of intervocalics or simple sonorization of geminate, perhaps influenced by Ardhamagadhi cerebrals. To me, this seems unnecessary, as <em>pṛthak</em> is often spelled <em>pṛthag</em> in compounds anyway; but what would I know?</p>
<p>Now, Pali <em>puthu</em> combines the senses of Sanskrit <em>pṛthu</em> (“expansive, manifold”) and <em>pṛthak</em> (“separate, individual”). We already have this in another technical Buddhist term: the puthujjana_ or “ordinary person”.</p>
<p><em>Puthutta</em> is used elsewhere of an “expanding” poison, but only in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.48/en/sujato#sn12.48:5.1" target="_blank">SN 12.48:5.1</a> in a philosophical sense, where it is said to be the “third cosmology”. As I point out in my notes on this Sutta, the series of cosmologies starting with the “oldest” (“all exists”) is perfectly literal, and refers to the Vedic Nāsadiya Sukta. In this philosophical sense it means “all is expansive”, a reference to discussions of the extent of the cosmos as infinite or limited.</p>
<p>Throughout the Rig Veda <em>pṛthu</em> is the broad expanse of earth or waters, spread out by Indra (eg. RV 10.113.4) and burned over by Agni (RV 10.156.3). It has sexual connotations, too: an ample womb (RV 10.99.2) or a fat ass (RV 10.86.8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.5.16, 3.5.1.11). Thus while “oneness” suggests the Divinity that underlies all, “expansiveness” suggests the broad world on which humans live. Thus the sacrificial cake should be spread expansively, but not too expansively, for that would make it human and therefore mortal (ŚB 1.2.2.9). We come back to the Nāsadīya Sūkta, where instead of <em>pṛthu</em> we find <em>tiraścīna</em> (“stretched across”; the two terms are synonymous at ŚB 6.3.3.19) describing the searching minds of the sage-poets: “Their cord was stretched across: Did something exist below it? Did something exist above? There existed placers of semen and there existed greatnesses. There was independent will below, offering above” (RV 10.129.5). “Greatnesses” refers to pregnancy, reinforcing the idea of the amplitude of creation.</p>
<p>Compare <em>puthutta</em> (“expansiveness”) here with <em>nānatta</em> (“diversity”) at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14.1/en/sujato#sn14.1:2.1" target="_blank">SN 14.1:2.1</a> or <em>vemattatā</em> (“disparity”) at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.13/en/sujato#sn48.13:1.6" target="_blank">SN 48.13:1.6</a>. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato#mn1:24.1" target="_blank">MN 1:24.1</a>, the Buddha taught “diversity” as the opposite fallacy to “oneness”. Whereas the Vedists came to see the world as an essential unity, from which the manifold forms of existence are a mere manifestation or illusion, the Jains argued that the world consisted of an irreducibly multiple and differentiated mass of distinct entities, a view criticized in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3.13 (<em>nānātvaṁ nindyate</em>). Both these fallacies take a particular mode of perception which is true in certain respects and make it into an absolute. The Buddha treats diversity as a way of analyzing experience, not as a metaphysical postulate.</p>
<p>Thus it is not merely incidental that the terms <em>sakkāya</em>, <em>puggala</em>, and <em>khandha</em> are shared with the Jains and not the Vedists. Both Buddhism and Jainism emphasized the diversity and complexity of existence as experienced. The difference is, the Jains regarded all of these real entities as eternal and indestructible; only the higher-order complex changed, but the underlying elemental realities. Compare the doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#dn2:26.2" target="_blank">DN 2:26.2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Great king, these seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. … If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the original sense of <em>puggala</em> was probably “an individual comprised of an extensive mass of disparate elements”, a “composite individual”. The closest English parallel might be the word we use for a creature comprised of various organs, an “organism”.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the way that Buddhist philosophers have always talked about the “person”. We’re very used to saying that what we consider to be an irreducible unity, a “person” or “self”, is in fact a set of “aggregates”, all of which are conditioned and changing. Over time, I think, the specifically technical understanding of <em>puggala</em> receded, and we thought of it simply as a word for person, but its role as a specifically Buddhist way of talking about persons remained central.</p>
<p>It seems likely that the Buddha himself invented this usage, employing <em>puggala</em> because it avoided Vedic terminology, while at the same time suggesting a connection with the <em>khandha</em> doctrine that the “individual” comprised a “mass” of components.</p>
<p>This suggests that a translator should avoid the normal practice of collapsing <em>puggala</em> into <em>purisa</em> as “person”. “Individual” works well for <em>puggala</em>. It is slightly distancing and technical; I think the unfamiliar <em>puggala</em> would have had a similar, slightly disorientating, effect on the original audience listening to the Pali, which was why the Buddha used it. He wanted us to think about ourselves in a new way, and invented a new word to describe more precisely who we are.</p>
