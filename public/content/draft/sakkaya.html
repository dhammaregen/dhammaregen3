<p>Wer den Buddhismus studiert, ist mit dem Begriff <em>sakkāya</em> vertraut, und diese Ansicht zu haben, ist eine der Fesseln, die uns an das Leiden bindet. Ich habe das Wort früher als „Identität“ (identity) übersetzt, aber in seinem jüngsten Werk, der Übersetzung des Suttanipāta, sagt der Ehrwürdige Bodhi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sakkāya</em>: der Verbund der fünf mit Anklammern verbundenen Aggregate. Eine Übersetzung des Wortes ist beinhae unmöglich. Meine früheren Versuche als „Persönlichkeit“ (personality) und „Identität“ (identity) werden dem Wort nicht gerecht. <em>Sakkāya</em> ist ein zusammengesetztes Wort aus <em>sat</em> = „existierend“ (existent) und <em>kāya</em> = „Körper“ (body), aber was gemeint ist, ist nicht nur der physische Körper, sondern die gesamte Anhäufung materieller und geistiger Faktoren, die die empirische Person ausmachen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jetzt gibt er es mit „persönliche Einheit“ (personal entity) wieder.</p>
<p>Lassen Sie uns schauen, warum es so schwer zu übersetzen ist, und sehen, ob wir einen Kontext freilegen können, der uns hilft, es aufzuklären.</p>
<p>Ein Grund für die Schwierigkeit ist, dass die Wurzeln des Wortes sehr allgemein sind, es aber in einer sehr spezifischen doktrinalen Bedeutung gebraucht wird.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sat</em> = „existierend“, auch „wirklich“, „wahr“, „gut“.</li>
<li><em>kāya</em> = „Körper“, auch „Kategorie“, „Masse“, „Substanz“.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first item is definitely <em>sat</em>, but in Pali, the prefix <em>sa-</em> can stem from the Sanskrit <em>sat</em> or <em>sva</em>, “own”, “self”. We know that isn’t the case here, because the doubled <em>kk</em> in <em>sakkāya</em> is created by the assimilation of the <em>t</em> in <em>sat</em>. Nonetheless, some Sanskrit and Chinese sources do take this in the sense of <em>sva-</em>.</p>
<p>This is understandable because is used in the context of the five aggregates, and is explained as the identification of the self with the five aggregates or one of them. Because it is in the context of “self” theory, translations often lean on the “self” side of things, with “personality”, “identity”, “own body” (Horner), “self-identity” (Suddāso), and so on. But it would seem to be a case where the word is being inferred purely from context, without considering what the word brings to the context.</p>
<p>Other translators lean on the “existent” side, rendering it as “reifying” (Wayman), “embodiment” (Nyanamoli, Anandajoti). Ven Bodhi’s “personal entity” straddles the two.</p>
<p>While the doctrinal explanation of <em>sakkāya</em> as the five aggregates is well understood, there seems to be little interest in asking <em>why</em> the Buddha used such a term. It all it means is being attached to the aggregates, why not say so? Why introduce an obscure technical term to explain a simple concept?</p>
<p>Given that <em>sakkāya</em> is used specifically to denote the wrong views and misunderstandings of non-Buddhists, it seems reasonable to search among non-Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>A search through the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical literature comes up blank. Not only is <em>sakkāya</em> not found, but even more interesting, <em>kāya</em> itself is not found. Or at least, I couldn’t locate it. If it is found, it’s certainly not in any doctrinally significant context.</p>
<p>But then I remembered that <em>kāya</em> is indeed found in a doctrinally central position in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato" target="_blank">DN 2</a>, in describing certain views of the non-Brahmanical ascetics.</p>
<p>View of Ajita of the Hair Blanket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the <em>kāya</em> of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the <em>kāya</em> of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the <em>kāya</em> of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the <em>kāya</em> of air. The faculties are transferred to space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>View of Pakudha Kaccāyana:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great king, these seven <em>kāyas</em> are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. What seven? The <em>kāyas</em> of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven <em>kāyas</em> are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand. If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven <em>kāyas</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, <em>kāya</em> does not mean “body”, but a “mass” or “substance” that forms the fundamental reality of existence.</p>
<p>Clearly <em>kāya</em>, from the point of view of the suttas, has a central significance in the non-Vedic ascetic movements that it does not have in Vedism. So we should look to them for more context.</p>
<p>The problem here is that most of these ascetics have vanished leaving little but the quotes in the Pali canon. To make it worse, their doctrines were not always attributed consistently or correctly in the Pali canon. However, without getting too much into the history, it is also true that these theorists were often closely related, may have practiced together, and shared ideas. So it’s not unreasonable to suppose that we will find a similar usage in the texts of the Jains, who are the only one of these groups to leave scriptures, although they stem from a later period.</p>
<p>There we have a lot more success, because there is a Jain concept of <em>astikāya</em>:</p>
<p>https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/astikaya</p>
<p><em>Astikāya</em> is merely a formal variation of the same word we know as <em>sakkāya</em>. So it seems clear it was a term the Buddha drew from the Jains, or from the ascetic teachers more generally.</p>
<p>There is a discussion of the concept in the Jain Bhagavati Sutra:</p>
<p>https://www.wisdomlib.org/jainism/book/bhagavati-sutra/d/doc374786.html</p>
<p>The basic points:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>astikāya</em> means “existent substance” or “ontological category”.</li>
<li>it refers to five things that define all reality: the medium of motion (<em>dharma</em>), the medium of rest (<em>adharma</em>), space (<em>ākāśa</em>), soul (<em>jīva</em>), and matter (<em>pudgala</em>).
<ul>
<li>the terminology here is very idiosyncratic to the Jains, so just roll with it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>these things include the state of liberation</li>
<li>they are pluralistic, many atomic entities making up one overall <em>astikāya</em>, hence the translation “ontological categories”.
<ul>
<li>this shows that the sense of <em>kāya</em> here is similar to <em>khandha</em>, i.e. “mass”, “conglomerate”, “category”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.wisdomlib.org/jainism/essay/a-study-of-the-philosophy-of-jainism/d/doc242108.html</p>
<p>https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/a-history-of-indian-philosophy-volume-1/d/doc209778.html</p>
<p>Thus the overall sense is “the mass of substances that make up all of reality”.</p>
<p>This is in broad agreement with the usage in the EBTs.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sakkāya</em> is defined as the five aggregates, emphasizing the closeness of <em>kāya</em> and <em>khandha</em> in the sense of “mass” rather than “body”.</li>
<li>It is treated in terms of the four noble truths, hence <em>sakkāya</em> = <em>dukkha</em> = all of conditioned reality.</li>
<li>The commentaries, which consistently analyze <em>sakkāya</em> correctly as <em>sat</em> + <em>kāya</em>, gloss it as <em>tebhūmakavaṭṭaṁ</em>, i.e. “cyclic existence in the three realms”.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is, therefore, no basis in “personal” renderings of the term, and even Bodhi’s “personal entity” does not go far enough, because <em>sakkāya</em> includes all phenomena, not just those pertaining to an individual.</p>
<p>A key difference with the Jains is that for the Buddha, Nibbāna is not included in <em>sakkāya</em>. And not just the Jains, but also “the Brahmā realm is impermanent, not lasting, and included within <em>sakkāya</em>” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.54/en/sujato" target="_blank">sn55.54</a>).</p>
<p>This answers our earlier question, why did the Buddha choose this term? What point was he trying to convey? He wanted to make it clear that in his teaching, unlike the Jains, the goal of Nibbana was not part of <em>sakkāya</em>.</p>
<p>This gives us a better sense of the word’s meaning and rhetorical purpose. How then to translate it?</p>
<p>Obviously we must reject any “personal” renderings, as they do not convey the sense of the word at all.</p>
<p>We should definitely translate <em>sakkāya</em> in some way that draws out the idea of “real”, “existent”, “substantial”.</p>
<p>Now, the Jain philosophy is that these <em>astikāyas</em> are a kind of substance that comprises all reality. They are defined, in fact as forms of <em>dravya</em> (“substance”):</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravya</p>
<p>This is an example of a kind of philosophical approach whose general name is “substantialism”.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory</p>
<p>We can draw upon this, and keep a broad consistency with the handling of <em>astikāya</em> in Jainism, by rendering <em>sakkāya</em> as “substance” or “substantial reality”, and <em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em> as “substantialist view” or “substantialist view of reality”.</p>
