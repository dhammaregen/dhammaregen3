[Zum Originaltext](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-the-gandhabba-and-male-anxiety/30928)

[MN 38](#/sutta/mn38/de/sabbamitta), die große Lehrrede über die Auflösung des Verlangens, sagt bekanntlich, dass ein *gandhabba* anwesend sein muss, damit eine Empfängnis stattfinden kann. Es ist so ein merkwürdiges Detail! Es hat viel Untersuchung und Diskussion ausgelöst, darunter auch mehrere Essays von mir.

Ich entwickelte diese Gedanken zunächst [in diesem Beitrag](#/wiki/mythologie/gandhabba), dem [ein ergänzendes Zitat](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/those-gandhabbas-sure-were-potent/28574) folgte. Doch etwas scheint an der ganzen Sache unbefriedigend zu sein, daher nehme ich einen neuen Anlauf. Dieser Essay baut überwiegend auf den früheren Vorstellungen auf, aber ich kann nun ein vollständigeres und zusammenhängenderes Bild erstellen.

Die buddhistische Tradition begnügt sich damit, eine rationalisierende Erklärung anzubieten: Es ist das Wesen, das geboren werden soll, von seinem Kamma gesteuert. Okay, gut, aber warum *gandhabba*? Es ist so eine merkwürdige Wahl! 

Das Hauptproblem ist, dass diese Vorstellung in [MN 38:26.2](#/sutta/mn38:26.2/de/sabbamitta) vorkommt, das eine doktrinale Lehrrede ist, die vom abhängigen Entstehen handelt. Aus dem Zusammenhang heraus erscheint sie wie eine seriöse doktrinale Aussage. Es ist allerdings ziemlich sicher, dass sie ursprünglich in [MN 93:18.61](#/sutta/mn93:18.61/de/sabbamitta) erschien, wo sie in einer Diskussion unter brahmanischen Weisen über die Kastenfrage viel mehr am Platz ist, und dass sie von hier aus zu MN 38 versetzt wurde. Das muss recht früh geschehen sein, da sie sich in Parallelen findet, aber alle buddhistischen Traditionen erklären sie ähnlich, ohne dem Ausdruck eine besondere Bedeutung zuzuschreiben: Es sei einfach das Individuum, das entsprechend seinem Kamma wiedergeboren werden soll. Ob sie so vom Buddha dargelegt wurde oder ob sie einfach als bequeme Erklärung für die Empfängnis von MN 93 übernommen wurde – sie hat im buddhistischen Kontext keine besondere doktrinale Bedeutung. 

Der entsprechende Zusammenhang in MN 93 ist, dass ein seltsamer „dunkler Eremit“ einige Weise zu der Kastenfrage herausfordert und sie zwingt, zuzugeben, dass sie nicht wissen, mit wem ihre Mutter oder ihr Vater möglicherweise geschlafen haben, selbst viele Generationen zurück, und dass sie auch die Kaste des *gandhabba* nicht kennen. 

Das klassische Studienmaterial für das Thema ist O.H. de A. Wijesekeras *Vedic Gandharva and Pali Gandhabba* von 1945, das Teil seiner *Buddhist and Vedic Studies* ist, wo er eine enorme Anzahl von Quellen in der brahmanischen Literatur von den Veden an zusammenträgt. Das ist Pflichtlektüre, aber sein enzyklopädischer Ansatz hat einen Preis. Wir lernen den Gandhabba als massives, komplexes, fraktales Mythologem kennen. Aber Mythen sind keine Komplexe von Vorstellungen. Sie sind die Grundlagen für rituelle Verrichtungen, die einen Zweck erfüllen. Dieser Zweck kann das Erwachsenwerden sein oder das Verscheiden der Toten oder der Beginn einer Jahreszeit. Oder er kann die Empfängnis eines Kindes sein. Um das Mythologem zu verstehen, müssen wir uns anschauen, wie die Vorstellung von Heirat und Empfängnis – die beide sehr eng verbunden sind – mythologisch verstanden werden. 

Der Locus classicus ist Rig Veda 10.85, das die grundlegende vedische Hochzeitszeremonie bringt. Die Braut ist Suryā, die Sonne in ihrem weiblichen Aspekt, und ihr Bräutigam ist der Mond, Soma. Das vertauscht nun die gebräuchlichere Geschlechterzuschreibung der beiden, und in der vedischen Mythologie wie auch anderswo fiden wir gewöhnlich, dass die Sonne männlich und der Mond weiblich ist. Doch nicht hier, und das ist ein wichtiges Detail. Die Sonne erscheint hier als Braut in ihrer Herrlichkeit, und ihre Schönheit und ihr Schmuck strahlen. Der Mond ist männlich aus einem ganz bestimmten Grund, den wir später herausfinden werden. 

Die Strophen, die uns interessieren, sind RV 10.85.21 und 22. Aus Jamison und Breretons Übersetzung: 

> “Rise up from here, for this woman has a husband.” I call on Viśvāvasu with reverence, with hymns.
> “Seek some other girl sitting in (the house of) her father, adorned (for marriage) [/smeared (with menstrual blood)]. That is your share by nature. Know this.”
>
> “Rise up from here, Viśvāvasu.” With reverence we invoke you.
> “Seek some other burgeoning maiden. Send the wife to join with her husband.”

In this invocation before the wedding, a certain Viśvāvasu is invoked to “rise up” from the bride (also at Atharva Veda 14.2.33–6, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.19). So who is he, and what is this all about?

Viśvāvasu is known quite widely in Vedic scriptures as a king of the Gandharvas, like Timbaru or Dhataraṭṭha. He features in a range of stories, but the most relevant is that, among his many other dalliances, he fathered with the nymph Menakā a daughter, who was immediately abandoned in a forest before being adopted by a local hermit and named Pramadvarā. So Viśvāvasu was a king, a libertine, and a deadbeat dad. The rites that ask him to leave the wife sweeten the deal by urging him to find some other maiden to inhabit, confirming that he is still a sleazebag.

The root idea of the *gandharva*, I believe, is the same as the Greek centaur, a man on a horse, randy and rapacious. In [DN 21](#/sutta/dn21/de/sabbamitta) we see the story of how Pañcasikha, another famed *gandharva*, becomes more mature as he falls in love and wants to commit in marriage with Suriyavaccasā, “Sunshine”, who obviously is the feminine sun here in line with the Vedic tradition. This establishes the character arc of the *gandharva*, from the horny teen playboy to the mature committed husband. Viśvāvasu obviously is not there yet.

Fine, but why is he asked to “rise up” from the bride? This point establishes a nexus of tension with the Pali, for there the *gandhabba* is said to be “present, at the ready”, rather than having to leave. At first I wondered whether this was a mere confusion, for the verb forms are similar (*paccupaṭṭhito* in Pali, *uttiṣṭhāto* in BU 6.4.19). But a closer look revealed something more subtle and quite a bit stranger.

We have already seen that the husband is identified with Soma, the moon. Soma is the milky liquid extracted on the altar of stone in the primary Vedic rite, and it is the whiteness of the liquid that suggests the lunar connection. It contains the essence of vitality and energizing life. In concrete form it was a drug.

Elsewhere, the *gandharva* is said to guard (Rig Veda 9.83.4) or steal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4) or actually be (Rig Veda 9.86.36) the Soma. As such, and in his role as the virile male, he is is the “father, begettor, kinsman”, by whose knowledge one becomes the “father’s father” (Arthavaveda 2.1.2–3).

Stay with me, for we are about to embark on a journey down the very pathways of the dead. These are detailed in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.10. The highest path, that of the gods, belongs to the wilderness contemplatives, who realize the truth and ascend to the Brahma realm. Less exalted is the path of the fathers, and less still the paths of those reborn as lesser animals and the like. But it is the path of the fathers, which leads to human rebirth, that concerns us here. From [CU 5.10.3–7](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-english/d/doc239192.html), with some changes in translation:

> Those who live in the village and perform acts of public service, charity, and so on, attain the world of smoke. From there they go to the world of the night; from night they go to the world of the dark fortnight; and from the dark fortnight they go to the world of the six months when the sun moves to the south. This means that they never attain the world of the year.
>
> From the six months of the southern solstice, they go to the world of the fathers, and from there they go to the sky. Then from the sky they go to the moon. This is King Soma. This is the food of the gods. The gods enjoy eating this food.
>
> Living in the world of the moon until the fruits of his work are exhausted, he then goes back to this world along the path he came. First going to the sky, he then goes to air. Having become air, he next becomes smoke. Having become smoke, he then becomes mist.
>
> Having become mist, it changes into clouds. Then from clouds, it becomes rain and falls to the earth. Finally it grows as paddy, barley, plants, trees, sesame, beans, and so forth. The change from this state is very difficult. Those who eat these things emit semen (*retaḥ siñcati*) just like themselves.
>
> Among them, those who did good work in this world [in their past life] attain a good birth accordingly. They are born as a brāhmin, a kṣatriya, or a vaiśya. But those who did bad work in this world [in their past life] attain a bad birth accordingly, being born as a dog, a pig, or as a casteless person.

It’s crucial to take seriously the quasi-material process involved here. Rebirth is not a matter of just a disembodied spirit. It is organic and ecological, and links the individual to the cycles of nature as they transform from one state to another. As to how these transformations relate to the concept of the eternal *ātman*, I will leave that to Vedic philosophers.

The person on the path of the fathers sojourns in the moon, explicitly identified as the masculine King Soma (*somo rājā*), before being ultimately emitted as semen. We thus have an implicit identification between Soma and semen. This connection is developed in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4, which we have cited above, and which is the primary Upanishadic source on matters of sex and procreation. Note that Mādhavānanda’s translation on [Wisdom Library](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka-upanishad/d/doc122237.html), which is normally a great source, omits many of the details due to prudery, but Radhakrishnan had no such qualms, so [check his translation on the Internet Archive ](https://archive.org/details/PrincipalUpanishads/page/n323/mode/2up) (deutsche Fassung von Dr. Paul Deussen [hier]](https://archive.org/details/sechzigupanishad00deusuoft/page/512/mode/2up?view=theater)).

Verse 3 compares a woman’s genitals with the altar on which the soma is pressed, extracting a milky liquid of potent energy. The connection between Soma and semen is thus made fully explicit. And we have already seen that *gandharva* as the “father” may be further identified as Soma, so *gandharava* the father = Soma = semen.

Semen is said to be “a man’s essence” (*rasaḥ … puruṣasya retaḥ*, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.1). And this would explain the descriptions elsewhere of the *gandharva* as lying within the waters (Rig Veda 9.86.36, 10.10.4) or within the womb (Rig Veda 10.177.2).

And finally we see the reason why the *gandharva* king Viśvāvasu was asked to “rise up” from the bride before intercourse with the husband. He lies within her as the seed of her former lovers, the “essence” of whom remains.

Implicit in all this is the unspoken assumption that the new child is formed from the semen. The ovum was unknown. The mother’s role, rather, was that of the earth, whose womb is moistened by menstrual blood just as the earth is moistened by rain. The earth is the receptacle and nurturer of the seed, but the seed itself is quite distinct. Thus the child, whether son or daughter, grows from the “man’s essence”.

A man’s anxiety about female sexuality lies just below the surface. [MN 93](#/sutta/mn93/de/sabbamitta) makes it clear that one can never really know who the mother has slept with. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.12 provides a handy set of curses for his wife’s lovers. Also bear in mind that such lovers need not necessarily be human. The Pali Abhidhamma text Kathāvatthu ([Kv 2.1](https://staging.suttacentral.net/kv2.1/en/aung-rhysdavids?lang=de&reference=main&highlight=true)) establishes that malicious deities might convey semen in a dream.

This is where it starts to get weird and creepy. [Atharva Veda 8.6 ](https://sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av08006.htm) details in unbelievably horrifying ways how demons of all stripes, including *gandharvas*, “creep between her thighs”. They are “slippery fiends” who eat raw flesh, biters and gropers dressed in hides, licking their lips, hairy ones who feed on babes unborn. Without the proper rites, they will devour the embryo or cause any manner of deformity.

> **Zwischenruf**
>
> * Wait what? You’re saying that *a woman might be raped by a demon in a dream, who leaves his seed to fester in her womb, mutating into a “hairy one” who eats her babies*?
> * Why yes, yes I am saying that.
> * 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
> * That seems like a healthy response.

This further explains why the *gandharva* is said to possess women (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.7.1, 3.3.1), sometimes driving them to madness. Wijesekera points out that sometimes men are also so possessed, but I think this is a secondary development, and the primary source of possession is the “man’s essence” inside a woman.

Biologically this is, of course, not how anything works. But it has its own internal logic, driven by the overarching anxiety in men to establish paternity. It is a man’s essence that creates a child, determining the all-important question of caste. But a man never really knows if his wife has had sex with another man. This creates an ongoing and fundamental anxiety, which this whole edifice of myth, doctrine, and ritual is erected to contain and control. The very fact of how complex, baroque, irrational, and downright weird the whole thing is attests to the potency of the irrational forces that drive it.

In [MN 93](#/sutta/mn93/de/sabbamitta) it is clear that the brahmins are not really convinced. Despite the fact that their own scriptures and doctrines deal with this issue in detail, they know rationally that they cannot know the caste of a child, and can never really establish paternity. This is of course a typical Buddhist approach, using rational inquiry to displace the superstitious smugness of the brahmins.

In any case, this makes it clear why the Sutta says the *gandhabba* must be present, while the Veda says Viśvāvasu must depart. Viśvāvasu is the king of *gandharvas*, and thus stands for them as a class or as their commander. When he leaves, he by implication takes with him all the *gandharvas* that might be lurking. Then the correct *gandhabba*—the “essence” of the husband—must be present for conception to succeed.

Finally, let me make one humble observation. In this mytheme we see the fundamental underpinnings of what today we call “toxic masculinity”. The *gandharva*, as a [horny deadbeat guitar player ](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201858/rs_634x1024-180608160044-634.johnny-depp.ct.060818.jpg), is the ideal to which modern incels aspire. If he cannot grow, he becomes what the Artharva Veda 8.6 calls the “fiend of evil name”, “Sniffer and Feeler”, dancing at night with the bray of asses and the smell of goats. Today the “evil name” is Andrew Tate or Donald Trump or Harvey Weinstein; or indeed, Chogyam Trungpa or Sogyal Rinpoche or any number of other “slippery fiends” who “pierce a woman’s loins with pain”.

This is not something new, or something that has been left unaddressed by cultures in the past. Anxiety about potency and paternity is a fundamental component, perhaps the single most important distinguishing feature, of the male psyche, and forms the foundation of misogyny. Patriarchal institutions like marriage traditionally aimed to subjugate women, yes, but they also tried to temper the worst of men. In freeing women from patriarchal suppression, it is crucial to find ways to address this deeply irrational male anxiety.
