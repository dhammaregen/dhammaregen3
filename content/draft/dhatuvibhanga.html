<p><a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-six-elements-fulfil-the-four-satipa-hanas-overlooked-meditation-instructions/29837" target="_blank">Zum Originaltext</a></p>
<p>I feel that the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 140</a>) and its explanation of the six elements meditation has been largely overlooked in modern discourse on satipaṭṭhāna in Early Buddhism. This post will attempt to draw out some of the implications and practical instructions to better understand the satipaṭṭhāna pericope in the EBTs, and the unfolding of meditation as understood by the suttas.</p>
<p>Usually teachers focusing on Early Buddhist meditation focus on the instructions for ānāpānasati and the early parts of the satipaṭṭhāna sutta(s). The latter can be better understood via the former, as ānāpānasati details a specific application of satipaṭṭhāna practice under one framework rather than a general description (as in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 10</a>), and it explains in detail how the practice is done to fulfil <em>all four</em> satipaṭṭhānā → the <em>bojjhaṅgā</em> → awakening.</p>
<p>I believe that the core <em>kāyānupassanā</em> practices of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta — meditation on the parts of the body and the four elements — can be seen as one integrated practice emphasized from different perspectives. This may explain why the passage on the thirty-one parts of the body is sometimes the only <em>kāyānupassanā</em> practice listed: the elements contemplation is just one way of doing it.</p>
<p>As for the complete fulfilment of these contemplations all the way through the four <em>satipaṭṭhānā</em> and the 7 awakening factors, we need not turn to the <em>ānāpānasati</em> formula to understand how these core practices unfolded in Early Buddhism; a corresponding description is found in the Dhātuvibhanga Sutta. It provides an alternative framework whereby body contemplation via the body parts and four elements is expanded to include <em>vedanā-</em>, <em>citta-</em> and <em>dhammānupassanā</em>. This affirms prior comparative findings on early <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice, and of course follows the same pattern of evolution as <em>ānāpānasati</em>.</p>
<p>First, I’ll quickly review <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice in the EBTs based on comparative research into the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas and references in the canon, supplemented by the understanding gained from the description of <em>ānāpānasati</em>. Then I’ll dive into analyzing the six elements meditation of the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta according to the prior framework. If you are already familiar with the first part, you may want to skip to the second section of the post.</p>
<p><strong>Cattāro Satipaṭṭhānā — The Root Practice</strong></p>
<p>Comparative research on the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 10</a>) and its parallels, as well as the formulas and definitions that accompany <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice in other suttas and collections, has narrowed down the original forms of meditation in the collection. Bhante Sujato’s <em>A History of Mindfulness</em> is a famous tome on this subject, specifically in re-focusing the role of <em>sammāsati</em>/<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> as being the main early Buddhist meditative practice that leads to <em>sammāsamādhi</em>, rather than a vipassanā technique.</p>
<p>The conclusions of these comparisons are that the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas are sectarian compilations which provide lists of what the various schools understood as fitting into the practices of each section. By comparing these lists of practices and assessing the evolution of formulas and passages in the various recension texts, we can find the set of <em>root</em> practices which characterized early Buddhist <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation.</p>
<p>The <em>vedanānupassanā</em> and <em>cittānupassanā</em> sections remain mostly unchanged, and are about growing sensitive to the refined feelings one experiences in meditation, and in collecting and composing the mind into <em>samādhi</em> as consciousness becomes more subtle and pliable. We can see with the <em>ānāpānasati</em> meditation that this involves growing sensitive to how the mind reacts and processes mental experiences (feelings, perceptions, etc.) and gradually stilling and calming them into deeper equanimity and composure.</p>
<p>The <em>kāyānupassanā</em> and <em>dhammānupassanā</em> sections, on the other hand, vary quite a bit in the various recensions. Nonetheless, a core can be clearly established. The <em>paṭikūlamanasikāra</em> section — attention to the repulsive — is undoubtedly the core, common part of <em>kāyānupassanā</em>. The Theravāda Vibhaṅga seems to preserve a reading of the sutta which contains only this passage. Secondarily, there is the meditation on the four elements, followed by the charnel ground contemplations. Both of these latter two are quite well established across the traditions, are very similar to the 31 parts of the body meditation, and are referenced in many other suttas in the canon about meditation.</p>
<p><em>Kāyānupassanā</em>, we see, is mostly concerned with meditating on the constituents and properties of the body to overcome the hindrances and cultivate a base of mental calm, joy, and equipoise. The practice is a mixture of calm, repeated observation and mindfulness, mixed with an edge of discernment and understanding the nature of the body. This unfolds into <em>vedanānupassanā</em> — the feelings that arise and develop within one’s embodied meditation — and <em>cittānupassanā</em> as the mind settles more and more towards <em>samādhi</em> and away from a scattered, hindered state.</p>
<p><em>Dhammānupassanā</em> is primarily about cultivating the awakening factors — the seven <em>bojjhaṅga</em>s — and understanding them in terms of their conditionality, that is, how they arise, cease, remain, etc. It is the process of evolving the meditation through to <em>samādhi</em> and into the most refined <em>upekkhā</em> where one can look onto the meditative experience itself with wisdom and equanimity. Secondarily, this also includes understanding the five hindrances in terms of conditionality (something, again, found in most editions of the text but not always under <em>dhammānupassanā</em>). Therefore, whereas <em>cittānupassanā</em> is about refining and establishing the mind into <em>samādhi</em>, <em>dhammānupassanā</em> is about understanding this meditative evolution in terms of conditionality, as well as reviewing it in terms of impermanence, dispassion, and relinquishment — qualities found in the <em>ānāpānasati</em> formula and inherent to the proper cultivation of the seven <em>bojjhaṅga</em>s. One uses their purified equanimity from meditation to reflect on the conditionality of the mind/mind qualities themself, and to relinquish the grounds for the hindrances or <em>āsavā</em>s permanently.</p>
<p>The <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> refrain emphasizes that these practices are to be done internally, externally, and both internally-and-externally. This is found in all recensions of the text, and matches very closely especially with the understanding of <em>kāyānupassanā</em> gained from comparative analysis. One contemplating the 31 parts contemplates them within one’s own body, in relation to other’s bodies, and in terms of their general nature both in oneself and others. The elements passages consistently emphasize that the elements are both internal and external, leading to an understanding where the elements are understood as such — properties of existence equivalent both internally and externally. The charnel ground contemplations emphasize focusing on one’s own body (internal) as of the same nature as an (external) decomposing body.</p>
<p><strong>The Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta and Six Elements Meditation</strong></p>
<p>With an understanding of how <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation is meant to look like and unfold in the suttas, we can turn to the meditation instructions given by the Buddha in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 140</a>. Most teachers have focused on <em>ānāpānasati</em> as the main instructions given by the Buddha for a full and complete meditative path with more detail. However, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 140</a> includes another set of meditation instructions that fulfill all four <em>satipaṭṭhānā</em> and leads to full awakening. This practice is based more on the description of <em>kāyānupassanā</em> in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta — namely, the division of the body into its parts and properties.</p>
<p>I will quote the relevant sutta passages, interjecting with commentary as to the relationship to <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice.</p>
<p>The instructions are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are these six elements: the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The additions here are space (<em>ākāsa-dhātu</em>) and consciousness (<em>viññāṇa-dhātu</em>). While specifically the four elements are attested to in the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas, we will see that the consciousness element ends up going outside the scope of just <em>kāyānupassanā</em> and therefore poses no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the earth element? The earth element may be <strong>interior or exterior.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see a phenomena which can be contemplated internally and externally as prescribed in the <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> refrain. This will apply to all five of the elements/properties of the body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the <strong>interior</strong> earth element? Anything hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes <strong>head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces</strong>, or anything else hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This is called the interior earth element.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A series of body parts identical to those found in the list of thirty-one parts, focusing solely on the solid ones under the category of earth. In this way the elements contemplation fulfills the parts of the body contemplation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>interior earth element and the exterior earth element</strong> are just the earth element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After contemplating an ‘aspect of the body’ (<em>kāye kāyānupassanā</em>) internally and externally, one is instructed to contemplate it both internally-and-externally, as is fulfilled by the above description. One understands the general nature and principle of the bodily phenomena for the purpose of understanding and calming of the hindrances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the earth element, <strong>detaching the mind from the earth element.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The practice unfolds by gradually releasing desire and interest in the sensual sphere (<em>kāmacchanda</em>), as well as aversion or resistance to it (<em>byāpāda</em>) — primary aims of <em>kāyānupassanā</em>. One develops a joyful, hindrance-free relationship to the bodily experience opening the doors for contemplation of feelings into <em>samādhi</em>. The same contemplation repeats with all five elements, filling in the other parts of the body and other aspects (such as internal heat, winds, orifices, etc.). I will abbreviate these partially.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the <strong>water element?</strong> The water element may be <strong>interior or exterior.</strong> … This includes <strong>bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine</strong>, or anything else that’s water, watery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the water element, <strong>detaching the mind from the water element.</strong> … And what is the <strong>fire element?</strong> … And what is the <strong>air element?</strong> …
And what is the <strong>space element?</strong> The space element may be <strong>interior or exterior.</strong> … This includes <strong>the ear canals, nostrils, and mouth; and the space for swallowing what is eaten and drunk, the space where it stays, and the space for excreting it from the nether regions.</strong> … When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the space element, <strong>detaching the mind from the space element.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There remains only <strong>consciousness</strong>, pure and bright. And what does that consciousness know? It knows <strong>‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ and ‘neutral’.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After contemplating the body with the previous five elements, there is the consciousness element (<em>viññāṇa-dhātu</em>). Despite alternative forms of teaching element meditation which immediately focus on an expansive awareness, the sutta description defines consciousness in terms of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) and its three manifestations (<em>sukha</em>, <em>dukkha</em>, <em>adhukkhamasukha</em>). Here we are turning to <em>vedanānupassanā</em>, equivalent to the second tetrad of <em>ānāpānasati</em>. Consciousness is qualified as “pure and bright” (<em>parisuddha</em> and <em>pariyodāta</em>). Considering all of the above, it seems that the <em>viññāṇa-dhātu</em> is here a stand-in for the refined, evolving experience of the mind and awareness as meditation progresses. This is the move of mind away from the realm of the body and senses and instead towards the subtle feelings and radiant awareness apart from the physical that leads to <em>jhāna</em>. As in <em>ānāpānasati</em>, this process starts out with the mental phenomena/activities (<em>cittasaṅkhārā</em>) — feelings and perceptions — and moves into more refined states of <em>samādhi</em> and <em>upekkhā</em>.</p>
<p>Here, then, the consciousness element is not referring to the plain consciousness aggregate, but rather is a stand-in for the remaining contemplations of <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> encompassing a full understanding of the interrelated experience of body-mind within consciousness (<em>nāmarūpa</em>), and leading to an evolution of consciousness (the training in <em>adhicitta</em>).</p>
<p>So although only feelings are described below, this would also seem to include early stages of <em>cittānupassanā</em> with the bright mind as one is understanding the arising of experiences and cultivating equanimity towards them to liberate the mind from subtle tendencies towards dullness, agitation, craving, or aversion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. <strong>When they feel a pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’</strong> They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.’ … <strong>When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’</strong> … <strong>When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’</strong> They know: ‘With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.’
When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops. In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bolded sections above are <em>identical</em> to the terminology used in the <em>vedanānupassanā</em> section of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas. This affirms that this part of the practice is indeed <em>vedanānupassanā</em>, and that what is described is the full unfolding of <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation as described in the early Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. The passage includes a simile for the nature of contact (<em>phassa</em>) and the conditionality of feelings, and seems to be used for refining the mind to see feelings and cultivate stronger equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em> — a term encompassing both a feeling experience and ‘looking on’ or understanding the nature of things, as in the final <em>bojjhaṅga</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There remains only <strong>equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.</strong>
It’s like when a deft <strong>goldsmith or a goldsmith’s apprentice</strong> prepares a forge, fires the crucible, picks up some gold with tongs and puts it in the crucible. From time to time they fan it, from time to time they sprinkle water on it, and from time to time they just watch over it. <strong>That gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and is ready to be worked.</strong> Then the goldsmith can successfully create any kind of ornament they want, whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland. In the same way, there remains only <strong>equanimity, pure, bright, pliable, workable, and radiant.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is a clear description of the mind in <em>samādhi</em>, most characteristic of the fourth <em>jhāna</em>. The simile of the goldsmith and refining gold is a recurring image for the development of the higher mind (<em>adhicitta</em>) and <em>samādhi</em> in meditation, and the terms characterizing the equanimity are standard descriptions of the mind which has been immersed in <em>samādhi</em> for cultivating wisdom. This then encompasses the <em>cittānupassanā</em> section. This was not detailed as specifically as in the third tetrad of <em>ānāpānasati</em>, as it was here described more from the perspective of <em>vedanānupassanā</em>. Nonetheless, the simile of the goldsmith informs us that the mind was observed, felt, adjusted, and purified into <em>samādhi</em> up to this point via a process of mutual tranquility and discernment characteristic of all early <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> meditation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They understand: ‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, <strong>my mind would develop accordingly</strong>. And this equanimity of mine, relying on that and grasping it, would remain for a very long time.
If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of <strong>infinite consciousness</strong>, my mind would develop accordingly. … <strong>dimension of nothingness</strong> … <strong>dimension of neither perception nor non-perception</strong> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage continues and finalizes the description of <em>cittānupassanā</em>. There is an understanding (<em>pajānāti</em>) of the state of the mind in various forms: unified, exalted, abundant, etc. as well as an understanding of the current equanimity of the mind. This is a practice of understanding the potential and general nature that the mind can have in various forms of awareness. It then shifts to understanding this in terms of conditionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They understand: ‘If I were to apply this equanimity, so pure and bright, to the dimension of infinite space, my mind would develop accordingly. <strong>But that is conditioned.</strong> … dimension of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither-perception-nor-non-perception, my mind would develop accordingly. <strong>But that is conditioned.’</strong>
They neither make a choice nor form an intention to continue existence or to end existence. Because of this, <strong>they don’t grasp at anything in the world.</strong> Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they <strong>personally become extinguished.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These final descriptions of the meditative process conclude with full awakening and the fruits of the practice. There is a looking on at the mind with equanimity <em>upekkhā</em>, done in dependence on seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and evidently ripening in relinquishment — the final culmination of the cultivation of the <em>bojjhaṅga</em>s and observation of conditionality: <em>dhammānupassanā</em>. This also matches with the final tetrad of <em>ānāpānasati</em>, similarly culminating in relinquishment and in understanding the nature of the mind via the strong <em>samādhi</em> and meditative experience cultivated beforehand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and displeasure, <strong>they watch over closely with equanimity. That’s why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles</strong>—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world.
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 118</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, there is a reference in this section of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato" target="_blank">MN 140</a> to the refrain in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta regarding not grasping anything in the world and knowledge and vision, the products of successful <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice.</p>
<p>Each step of the way, there is a cultivation of tranquility (<em>samatha</em>) and discernment (<em>vipassanā</em>) via all four applications of mindfulness. The above practice, then, is of much fruit and great benefit; it fulfils the four <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>s, which fulfill the seven <em>bojjhaṅga</em>s, which fulfill knowledge and liberation. It matches with the descriptions of <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> practice as found in the <em>mūla-satipaṭṭhāna sutta</em> (a hypothetical reconstruction of the early practices) and the development of <em>ānāpānasati</em> which is meant to fulfil the same principles.</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p><em>Kāyānupassanā</em> involves reviewing the body parts and properties of the body internally, externally, and internally-and-externally. It involves detaching the mind from the body for freedom from the hindrances, and understanding the nature of the body as <em>anattā</em> (for further tranquility and the cultivation of <em>samādhi</em>). <em>Vedanānupassanā</em> and <em>cittānupassanā</em> lead to an understanding and calming of feelings, culminating in deep <em>samādhi</em> in which the mind can evolve into various deep states of awareness. <em>Dhammānupassanā</em> reviews the conditionality and evolution of the mind into these states based on the previous experience and knowledge gained in the evolution of consciousness thus far — that is, the abandoning of the hindrances and evolution of the seven awakening factors — so as to culminate in a clear understanding of the mind and relinquishment of all assets (<em>vossagga</em>) via those awakening factors.</p>
<p>While I’m certainly aware that many scholars and teachers know of this passage, it is curious to me that very few have discussed it in detail when dissecting <em>satipaṭṭhānā</em> in Early Buddhism to the best of my knowledge. Please let me know if you have heard people discussing it in terms of <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> before! I’d be glad to give credit where credit is due! :smiley:</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this practice or the cultivation of the four <em>satipaṭṭhānā</em> in Early Buddhism?</p>
<p>Viel Mettā und frohes Üben.</p>
