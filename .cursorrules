# Dhammaregen3 Project Rules

This is a Buddhist text study application built with Vue.js and the EBT-Vue3 framework.

## Project Structure
- `content/` - Markdown content files for the website
- `public/` - Static assets (audio, images, HTML)
- `src/` - Source code
- `node_modules/ebt-vue3/` - EBT framework with audio playback functionality

## Key Technologies
- Vue.js 3 with Vite
- EBT-Vue3 framework for Buddhist text presentation
- Web Audio API for text-to-speech
- Markdown for content management

## Important Notes
- Audio playback uses Web Audio API with Safari-specific fixes for sample rate issues
- Content is in German (monolingual: "de")
- Audio files are stored in `public/audio/`
- The application serves Buddhist texts with audio pronunciation

## Development
- Use `npm run dev` to start development server
- Audio fixes are applied to node_modules/ebt-vue3 files
- Safari requires specific sample rate handling to prevent chipmunk audio

## Code Style
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use German for UI text and content
- Maintain accessibility for audio playback
